## Overview
This project represents the first project that I would consider a game in my game development journey. It was made using a tutorial on Udemy and assets provided by the online course. The game is a small top-down car game, driving around the map and delivering "pizzas".

## Technologies Used
The game was made using Unity 2022.3.34f1

## Gameplay
- The premise of the game is to move the car around the map picking up <span style="color:#3AD2FF">pizzas (blue boxes)</span>  and delivering them to a <span style="color: #FA2200">person (red circle)</span>.  
- The game uses colliders set to triggers to represent the pizzas and the person you deliver the pizza to.  
- While the car is empty is is shaded <span style="color: #FA2200">red</span>. Once a pizza has been acquired it turns to <span style="color:#3AD2FF">blue</span>.
- The <span style="color: #FA9600">orange elipse</span> is used as a speed bump that makes the car drive slower. The car will continue to drive slow until it hits an object (e.g. a house).
- The <span style="color: #1BFE23">green triangle</span> indicates a speed boost which increases the speed of the car. 
- there are currently only 3 pizza boxes in the game and once they have been delivered the game is complete.

## Development Process
This project is a demo project that showcases my introduction to the fundamentals of Unity. Using an online course explaining the key concepts and supplied assets, I was able to put together this project.

## Reflection and Next Steps
Some of the key concepts covered in this project were:
- Variables
- If statements
- Triggers
- Colliders
- Componants
- Referencing
- Using serialized field in scripts
