Welcome to Poetry in Motion, an insight into my software development path and a reflection of my process. My name is Zain Altaf, a passionate human with the desire to learn and create.  

This blog is purely a showcase of progress. My blog posts will include notes that I make on specific things that I am working on as a reference for later on. I may also post ideas and whatever comes to mind really.  

I'll try to tag the things that may be useful for you separately from the things that are useful to me but you never know, you might learn something from my mistakes ;). Feel free to [contact me](contact.md) if you feel there is a mistake or something you'd like to point out or see changed, I am open to all suggestions.  

If you want to support me you can buy me a [coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/zainaltaf) ☕️. If you want to work one something with me click the contact button up top. Cheers.
