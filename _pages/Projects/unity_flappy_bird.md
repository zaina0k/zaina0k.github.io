## Overview
This project acted as an exercise to test my experience and knowledge of Unity to build a game from scratch. I chose to remake Flappy Bird, an old popular iPhone arcade game. Principly the game is simple... flap the birds wings to get through as many pipes as possible.

## Technologies Used
The game was made using Unity 2022.3.34f1

## Gameplay
- The premise of the game is to control the flight of the bird as they fall to gravity. Pressing the space bar will give the bird a bit of height.
- An infinite number of green pipes will spawn with a space in the middle which the bird can fly between. Touching the green pipes causes the death sequence.
- There is no win sequence as this is an infinite game and is instead based on how high a score you can achieve. Points are given for every set of pipes the bird passes through.
